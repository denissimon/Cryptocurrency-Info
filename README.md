Example iOS app designed using MVVM-C and Layered Architecture. Uses Swift Concurrency.

The app shows cryptocurrency prices and other related info. Built with Messari API.

It has two modules: AssetsList and AssetDetails. The list of cryptocurrencies is loaded in batches.

### Built with

- [SwiftEvents](https://github.com/denissimon/SwiftEvents) - The easiest way to implement data binding and notifications. Includes Event\<T\> and Observable\<T\>. Has a thread-safe version.
- [URLSessionAdapter](https://github.com/denissimon/URLSessionAdapter) - A Codable wrapper around URLSession for networking.
- [Toast-Swift](https://github.com/scalessec/Toast-Swift) - A Swift extension that adds toast notifications to the UIView object class.
- [UAObfuscatedString](https://github.com/UrbanApps/UAObfuscatedString) - A simple category to hide sensitive strings from appearing in your binary.

The dependency manager is [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). Run `pod update` to update pods.

### Requirements

iOS version support: 15.0+. Xcode 13.0+, Swift 5.5+
